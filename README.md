# Language for Quiz Compiler and Questions Interpreter
Project of **Linguagens Formais e Autómatos**, made by Beatriz Rodrigues, Bruno Sá Lopes, Daniel Correia, Diogo Correia, Lara Rodrigues.
This project uses **ANTLR4** with **Java** to create an Interpreter and a Compiler.
## Interpreter
The Interpreter is used to fetch questions data from a file with the extention *.qst*. This data is meant to be used by the compiler to create a Quiz.
## Compiler
The Compiler builds a Quiz according to the *.quiz* file written and the questions fetched from the *.qst* file.
