# Language for Quiz Compiler and Questions Interpreter
Project of **Linguagens Formais e Autómatos**, made by [Beatriz Rodrigues](https://github.com/bea-rodrigues), [Bruno Sá Lopes](https://github.com/Bruno-SLopes), [Daniel Correia](https://github.com/danielvcorreia), [Diogo Correia](https://github.com/digas99), [Lara Rodrigues](https://github.com/Lararodrigues1).
This project uses **ANTLR4** with **Java** to create an Interpreter and a Compiler.
## Interpreter
The Interpreter is used to fetch questions data from a file with the extention *.qst*. This data is meant to be used by the compiler to create a Quiz.
 
## Compiler
The Compiler builds a Quiz according to the *.quiz* file written and the questions fetched from the *.qst* file.
