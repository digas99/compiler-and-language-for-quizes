# Language for Quiz Compiler and Questions Interpreter
Project of **Linguagens Formais e Autómatos**, made by Beatriz Rodrigues, Bruno Sá Lopes, Daniel Correia, Diogo Correia, Lara Rodrigues.
This project uses **ANTLR4** with **Java** to create an Interpreter and a Compiler.
## Interpreter
The Interpreter is used to fetch questions data from a file with the extention *.qst*. This data is meant to be used by the compiler to create a Quiz.
### Files to consider:
 - **Source Code:** *linguagem_questions.qst*
 - **Grammar:** *Questions.g4*
 
## Compiler
The Compiler builds a Quiz according to the *.quiz* file written and the questions fetched from the *.qst* file.
### Files to consider:
 - **Source Code:** *example.quiz*
 - **Grammar:** *Quiz.g4*
